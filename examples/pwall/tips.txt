You could use the command
python pwall.py -n pwall -gp thickness length height -gpv 8 20 30
You may also notice that there is a parameter "draft" in the decorator @aw.engine.amworkflow("draft")
This will trigger a QT5 window and you can preview your design after clicking "Display Geometry".
In draft mode no data will be stored in db.
To create a real model, simply delete the string "draft".
