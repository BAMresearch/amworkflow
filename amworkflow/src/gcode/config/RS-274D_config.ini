[General]
; This section is used to initialize the machine.
; (general functions) specify how to interpolate and move to the coordinate locations following the code until changed or until a new layer
is generated (modal).
G90 = absolute coordinate
G91 = incremental coordinate
G92 = set current position to 0

G70 = use inch
G71 = use mm
G54 = use coordinate system G54

G1 = Set coordinate

[Draw and Flash]
; (plot functions) select and control tools, specify line type, etc.
D01 = move to the x-y location specified with the shutter open
D02 = move to the x-y location specified with the shutter closed
D03 = move to the x-y location specified with the shutter closed and flash

[Miscellaneous]
; (miscellaneous functions) perform a variety of functions such as
program stop and origin specification.
M00 = pause
M01 = pause
M02 = end of program

[coordinate]
X = x coordinate
Y = y coordinate
Z = z coordinate
I = x offset
J = y offset
